They were the top two hundred students from all over the Philippines who passed the examination for the Philippine Science High School, which was created for the purpose of giving an education highly enriched in the Sciences to exceptionally gifted Filipino children. Selected from the best and brightest from all over the country, they endure college-level courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics from their sophomore year onwards. Those who can make it are hailed as the future science and technology leaders of the New Republic, those who don\u0026rsquo;t are deemed unfortunate victims of natural selection. They all learn however that they are neither isolated from the real world, nor are they exempted from living real lives. They find the world outside, erupting into the People Power revolution in 1986 against the Marcos dictatorship, being replicated within the school as they struggle to graduate, contend with teachers, classmates, family, school officials, and a new classification to segregate students meeting the high standards of excellence from those who do not.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePisay will be shown February 21\u0026ndash;27 exclusively at the following SM theaters: SM North Edsa Cinema 8; SM Megamall Cinema 9; SM Manila Cinema 4; SM Southmall; SM Fairview Cinema 6; SM San Lazaro Cinema 6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e-kyo-\u003c/p\u003e\n","type":"rich_text"},{"type":"youtube_video","id":"K1AKbcLW-pY"},{"type":"youtube_video","id":"zuXGrIWDZ5I"}],"dateCreated":{"$date":"2008-02-12T16:30:06.000Z"},"dateUpdated":{"$date":"2011-02-10T01:37:49.000Z"},"status":"archived","description":"","image":"","keywords":"","__v":4}

I guess the bottomline here is that how hard you need to work out depends on your primary goal. Is it to loose weight? Is it to increase your athletic performance (like ride faster when cycling) or extend your endurance (increased distance when biking)? One can also deduce from this that there is such a thing as a sweet zone when working out. If you overdo it (aka overtrain), you risk working so hard that it will take longer for your body to recover or you could be in pain (and with very little gain at that). This could be among the reasons why people who try gym memberships eventually give up after a few months when they think feel they\u0026#39;ve been working very hard at the gym and yet don\u0026#39;t get the results they expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the way, in case you\u0026#39;re wondering how to figure out your maximum heart rate, a quick and easy formula for HRmax is: 210 - [your age] (this is in beats per minute).

To anyone who has spent some time at one point or another on a treadmill, stationary bike or at the apartment gym, I would highly recommend getting a heart rate monitor. This particular model tells you to kick it up a notch if you're below target and beeps to slow you down a little when you have exceeded your target range. The best part is getting a better idea of how much return on investment you get (i.e. calories burned) with time spent exercising. I think that in itself is a pretty good motivator to stay into the healthy habit of being physically active.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e-kyo-\u003c/p\u003e"}],"dateCreated":{"$date":"2008-03-08T20:21:56.000Z"},"dateUpdated":{"$date":"2008-03-08T20:21:56.000Z"},"status":"archived"}

During that time the last 3 activity shoes I've bought before I started to go to the gym were hiking shoes from Nike, Salomon, Columbia and recently a bargain trail shoe from Skechers. The last one was a wide-fit all black trail shoe which was more suited for mountain biking and spinning class. After several weeks of wearing that one it quickly became apparent it was not made for running on the treadmill as it frequently triggered my cramps near my \u003ca href=http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/03/100103-004-EEC280DB.jpg target=_blank\u003eflexor digitorum longus tendon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI figured I need to get back to the drawing board and find a real running shoe that has a flexible forefoot that would allow me to get a better feel of the pavement while providing sufficient cushioning on the heel. I must be getting old now cause I've found that I didn't really like the new designs from Nike. I was curious about the ASICs and could probably be swayed to get ones from Adidas but found the old school design from New Balance more to my liking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter two weeks, I can say that I'm very pleased with this pair and got it for a fair price too at a discount retailer. I still have to experience the recurrence of my leg cramps on the treadmill which is usually triggered during the cold season. With the Skechers, they occured even during the peak of summer for some reason. I'm guessing this has to do with how the shoe absorbs impact when I pound on the pavement (I'm more than 200lbs).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe New Balance MT 460 trail running shoe has just the right amount of foam thickness that I've been looking for and without the usually thick heels found on some hiking or cross-training shoes. Padding is sufficiently balanced from heel to midfoot to forefoot (no pun intended) .

On the weekend of the summer solstice in 2009, if all goes as planned I will attempt to hike up this famous 17-mile trail with anybody who is interested to come along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy agenda are twofold: first, cross this item out of my bucket list and second, improve my current fitness level so that I could enjoy hiking more. I am not sure whether I will have the guts nor the endurance to climb up the banister cables yet. A granite path that's 475 feet high with an almost 45 degree incline. But that's not the crazy part, they say it takes about 15 minutes to go up that portion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom what I read, the real challenge would be the brutal 4,700 feet of elevation gain that you will make from around 4,000 feet at the trailhead by the valley floor. The fact that you have to complete it within 10 to 12 hours while the sun is still up means that pacing with primary focus on safety would be very important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow this is not something I am doing on a total whim since I've visited Yosemite more than a couple of times. And one summer in 2006, along with a bunch of friends and relatives, we hiked the Mist Trail to the top of Vernal Falls (first time to the top, second time to the base). Granted that is nothing compared to the full Half Dome route but I was definitely at a worse physical condition at the time and yet that experience very much made an impression upon me. I said to myself that it won't surely be the last and that one day, I hope to be able enough to prepare for the Half Dome Hike at least once. Some would even call it the Hike of a Lifetime. [That to me translates as: it's so brutal, you probably might never do it AGAIN].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/ksuayan/234039034/ title=Vernal Falls by ksuayan, on Flickr\u003e\u003cimg src=http://farm1.static.flickr.com/94/234039034_584089b803.jpg width=334 height=500 alt=Vernal Falls border=0 /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo starting today and with about 9 months to get in shape (most guidebooks recommend at least 2 months), I am inviting you to join us on this epic adventure.

At about 3.75 oz they cost a little more than the typical brands that we get at less than $2 a can but still much cheaper than if you get them elsewhere.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59dee5be337d944aa2d63a71"},"title":"Photography Notes","name":"photography-notes","excerpt":"","content":[{"content":"\u003cp\u003ePhotography is just like any other visual art form. It involves appreciation of art basics we learned back in high school: shape, balance, composition, tonal values (light vs. dark), color theory, texture, pattern, perspective, form. On another level, it could be about capturing your emotion at a particular instant, a report of a historic event as it unfolds, a memento of significant life events kept for posterity, or a visual means to sell an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a picture is taken, one must ask: what is the subject? Why is it interesting? What particular attribute of the subject do you want to capture? How could this quality be best presented visually? As the person taking this picture, you have a choice of keeping everything in sharp focus or lead the eye to a particular center of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou also decide how fast or how long you want the camera to take this slice of time (shutter speed). This can be a tiny fraction like 1/250th of a second, several minutes, or even hours if your camera allows it. In the grand scheme of things, time really is relative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps one of the most important aspect of photography is how you frame a shot (aka composition). You decide what goes inside that frame and more importantly, what gets excluded. A traditional photograph is a two dimensional representation of the three dimensional world we live in. That in itself is part of the challenge: a magical photograph can engulf the viewer in a total immersive experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePhotography is about understanding light and its qualities. You need to be aware from which direction this light is coming from and what type it is: your on camera flash, the street lamp to the left of your subject, or the setting sun behind it. Different light sources emit a dominant color in the visual spectrum. A tungsten lamp tends to be warm or yellowish, while some daylight are more biased towards cooler or bluish hues. A light source has shape and its size matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou choose where to stand when you take a photograph. This vantage point influences how the viewer might interpret your relationship with your subject. For example you can make a person appear to be powerful by shooting from a low vantage point with a wide angle lens and you can do the opposite say by shooting from the top. Photojournalist Robert Capa once said: If your photos are not good enough, you are not close enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBe brutal with editing. Developing one\u0026#39;s personal preference on what is visually appealing demand critical assessment and the courage to admit when it is not. Editing a large pile of photographs down to the few good ones is your responsibility, not the viewer\u0026#39;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake photos of those subjects that really matter to you. Explore the different genres. Study the works of famous photographers and what it is about their work that makes it important. They may or may not resonate with your own aesthetic and that is perfectly OK. Develop your personal vision by seeking inspiration and being open to constructive critique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLearn the rules so you know how (and when) to break them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePhotography is storytelling. By choosing where you point your camera, you are sharing with the world those things that matter most to you.
